TechTeam is a Discord Sercer which aims to bring the technological community together through assistance and teamwork.

  - TechTeam Corner, the name of the server, is a fairly new server with a growing population
  - Has development on its "official" website (or the GitHub repository you are on now)
  - TechBot can't shut up

# WebCorner Guidelines!

  - When making edits, use **primary** branch
  - Feel free to download the website and modify it within reason if you wish to
  - Know that the pages themselves are currently unlicenced, but we ask that you do not copy-paste our time and effort!


Please note:
  - Do NOT constantly ask for your (or *primary*) branch to be merged, it will be done in good time after you have made a request
  - To make sure that we can be sure who you are, we ask that you must be a member to participate in development on the Discord server
  - Don't modify the base (*main.css*) stylesheet unless you are changing pre-existing parameters, create a new one

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Discord Server]

### Partnership

If you want to help out in a different way, or if you don't know how to use HTML, CSS or JavaScript,
you can become a registered Staff or Tech Support member on the Discord server (applications will
be necessary). It is also greatly appreciated if you can help grow the server through sharing it
with others, your friends, your family, your followers on social media. Remember, the community is
for everyone, no matter how good they are at using technology!

### BackwardsNode/Recommends
Use GitHub Desktop for making edits or commits, for some people it makes life much easier.
